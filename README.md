## ZMK Configuration for Handwired, Wireless Skeletyl
This repository contains custom ZMK configuration for handwired [Skeletyl](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Skeletyl) build. The build log for the entire keyboard itself can be found [here](https://elescia.wordpress.com/2022/02/27/handwired-wireless-skeletyl/).

Do note that the keymap file under `config/boards/shield/skeletyl/` is the *default* keymap, while the one under `config/` is the one that will be compiled and should be modified.
